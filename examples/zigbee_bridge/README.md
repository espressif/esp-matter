# Zigbee Bridge

This example demonstrates a Matter-Zigbee Bridge that bridges Zigbee devices to Matter fabric.

The Matter Bridge device is composed of two parts: The RCP running on
ESP32-H2 and the bridge app running on ESP32.

See the [docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-matter/en/latest/esp32/developing.html) for more information about building and flashing the firmware.

## 1. Additional Environment Setup

### 1.1 Hardware connection

Connect the two SoCs via UART, below is an example setup with ESP32
DevKitC and ESP32-H2 DevKitC:

![Zigbee Bridge Hardware Connection](../../docs/_static/zigbee_bridge_hardware_connection.jpg)

|  ESP32 Pin  | ESP32-H2 Pin |
|-------------|--------------|
|   GND       |    GND       |
|   GPIO4     |    GPIO7     |
|   GPIO5     |    GPIO8     |

### 1.2 Build and flash the RCP (ESP32-H2)

```
cd ${IDF_PATH}/examples/zigbee/esp_zigbee_rcp/
idf.py --preview set-target esp32h2
idf.py -p <port> build flash
```

The Matter Bridge will run on the ESP32 and Zigbee network will be
formed.

## 2. Post Commissioning Setup

### 2.1 Discovering Zigbee Devices

You can read the parts list from the Bridge to get the number of the
bridged devices.

```
descriptor read parts-list 0x7283 0x0
```

If there is no other Zigbee device on the Zigbee Network, you will get
an empty result. Example:

```
Data = [

],
```

### 2.2 Setup Zigbee Bulb on ESP32-H2

Build and run Zigbee Bulb app on another ESP32-H2 board.

```
cd ${IDF_PATH}/examples/zigbee/light_sample/light_bulb
idf.py --preview set-target esp32h2
idf.py -p <port> build flash monitor
```

The Zigbee Bulb will be added to the Zigbee Network and a dynamic
endpoint will be added on the Bridge device. You can read the parts list
again to get the dynamic endpoint ID.

```
descriptor read parts-list 0x7283 0x0
```

The data will now contain the information of the connected Zigbee
devices. Example:

```
Data = [
    1, 
],
```

It means that the Zigbee Bulb is added as Endpoint 1 on the Bridge
device. You can read the cluster servers list on the dynamic endpoint.

```
descriptor read server-list 0x7283 0x1
```

This will give the list of supported server clusters. Example:

```
OnDescriptorServerListListAttributeResponse: 4 entries
    [1]: 6
    [2]: 29
    [3]: 57
    [4]: 64
```

### 2.3 Control the bulb with chip-tool

Now you can control the Zigbee bulb using the chip tool.

```
onoff toggle 0x7283 0x1
```

## 3. Device Performance

### 3.1 Memory usage

The following is the Memory and Flash Usage.

-   `Bootup` == Device just finished booting up. Device is not
    commissioned or connected to wifi yet.
-   `After Commissioning` == Device is connected to wifi and is also
    commissioned and is rebooted.
-   device used: esp32c3_devkit_m
-   tested on:
    [6a244a7](https://github.com/espressif/esp-matter/commit/6a244a7b1e5c70b0aa1bf57254f19718b0755d95)
    (2022-06-16)

|                         | Bootup | After Commissioning |
|:-                       |:-:     |:-:                  |
|**Free Internal Memory** |66KB    |62KB                 |

**Flash Usage**: Firmware binary size: 1.5MB

This should give you a good idea about the amount of free memory that is
available for you to run your application's code.

Applications that do not require BLE post commissioning, can disable it using app_ble_disable() once commissioning is complete. It is not done explicitly because of a known issue with esp32c3 and will be fixed with the next IDF release (v4.4.2).

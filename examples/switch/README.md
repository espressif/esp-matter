# Light

This example creates a Color Temperature Light device using the ESP
Matter data model.

See the [docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-matter/en/main/esp32/developing.html) for more information about building and flashing the firmware.

## 1. Additional Environment Setup

No additional setup is required.

## 2. Post Commissioning Setup

No additional setup is required.

## 3. Device Performance

### 3.1 Memory usage

The following is the Memory and Flash Usage.

-   `Bootup` == Device just finished booting up. Device is not
    commissionined or connected to wifi yet.
-   `After Commissioning` == Device is conneted to wifi and is also
    commissioned and is rebooted.
-   device used: esp32c3_devkit_m
-   tested on:

|                         | Bootup | After Commissioning |
|:-                       |:-:     |:-:                  |
|**Free Internal Memory** |108KB   |105KB                |

**Flash Usage**: Firmware binary size: 1.26MB

This should give you a good idea about the amount of free memory that is
available for you to run your application's code.

Applications that do not require BLE post commissioning, can disable it using app_ble_disable() once commissioning is complete. It is not done explicitly because of a known issue with esp32c3 and will be fixed with the next IDF release (v4.4.2).

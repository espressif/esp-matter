Overview
========
The Hello World demo application provides a sanity check for the new SDK build environments and board bring up. The Hello
World demo prints the "Hello World" string to the terminal using the SDK UART drivers. The purpose of this demo is to
show how to use the UART, and to provide a simple project for debugging and further development.
Note: Please input characters no more than rx FIFO depth at a time. If you input too many characters each time, the receiver may overflow
because the low level UART uses simple polling way for receiving. If you want to try inputting many characters each time,
just define DEBUG_CONSOLE_TRANSFER_NON_BLOCKING in your project to use the advanced debug console utility.

Toolchain supported

- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and Mini USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the hello world demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
hello world.

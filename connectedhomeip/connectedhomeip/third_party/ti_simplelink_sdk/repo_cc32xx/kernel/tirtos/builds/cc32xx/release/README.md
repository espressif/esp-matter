## Project Summary

This project contains settings to disable the standard debug features in
TI-RTOS.

## Project Usage

This project is intended to be used by applications that need a "production"
TI-RTOS configuration that does not include debug features.  Multiple
applications can use this project.

This project is the default configuration used by most of the SimpleLink
examples. It was selected as the default to minimize code size.

Please refer to the TI-RTOS Kernel section in the SimpleLink MCU SDK User's
Guide for the details on how applications use this project.

    "description": "<p>The TI Drivers API exposes the functionality of the hardware-specific drivers in the same way across all TI SimpleLink devices, giving developers portable, feature-rich access to a variety of peripherals. TI Drivers are open source [Berkeley Software Distribution license (BSD)] and built on the hardware abstraction layer, offering full access to the device’s complete capability. This device-agnostic approach provides easy portability of the application code across SimpleLink devices now and into the future. Other peripherals exposed through these intuitive and consistent TI driver APIs include analog-to-digital converter (ADC), SPI, PWM and GPIO, among many others. With full access to the hardware abstraction layer through the TI Drivers, developers can further optimize their applications by leveraging the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) or directly accessing the microcontroller with register-level programming. TI Drivers allow customers to make the application exactly what it needs to be.</p>"

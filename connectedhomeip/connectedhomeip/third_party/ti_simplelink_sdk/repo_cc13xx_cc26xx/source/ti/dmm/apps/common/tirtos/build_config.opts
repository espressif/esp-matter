/*
    The following is a list of all possible build defines and corresponding options
    that can be set for each define:

    GATT_DB_OFF_CHIP        - Indicates that the GATT database is maintained off the chip on the
                              Application Processor (AP).

    GAP_BOND_MGR            - Used to include the Bond Manager

    HOST_CONFIG             (BLE Host Build Configurations) Possible Options:
        PERIPHERAL_CFG      - Used to include the GAP Peripheral Role support
        CENTRAL_CFG         - Used to include the GAP Central Role support
        BROADCASTER_CFG     - Used to include the GAP Broadcaster Role support
        OBSERVER_CFG        - Used to include the GAP Observer Role support

    BLE_V41_FEATURES        Configure the stack to use features from the BLE 4.1 Specification
        L2CAP_COC_CFG       - Enable L2CAP Connection Oriented Channels

    BLE_V50_FEATURES        Configure the stack to use features from the BLE 5.0 Specification
                            The following BLE 5.0 features are enabled by default and cannot
                            be disabled.
        PHY_2MBPS_CFG       - Enable 2 Mbps data rate in the Controller
        HDC_NC_ADV_CFG      - Enable High Duty Cycle Non-Connectable Advertising
        CHAN_ALGO2_CFG      - Enable Channel Selection Algorithm 2

    HCI_TL_FULL             - All supported HCI commands are available via the Tranport Layer's NPI.
                            - Intended for NP solution.
    HCI_TL_PTM              - Only those HCI commands needed for Production Test Mode are available
                            via the Transport Layer's NPI
                            - Intended for SOC solutions where, during production, accesss is temporarily
                              needed (e.g. for PHY testing using Direct Test Mode, etc.).
    HCI_TL_NONE             - No supported HCI commands are available via the Transport Layer's NPI.
                            - Intended for SOC solutions.

    Below is general information for using and/or changing this configuration option file:

    Combo Roles:        Combo roles can be set by defining multiple roles for HOST_CONFIG. The possible
                        combo roles and HOST_CONFIG defines are:
                        Peripheral + Observer  :    PERIPHERAL_CFG+OBSERVER_CFG
                        Central + Broadcaster  :    CENTRAL_CFG+BROADCASTER_CFG
                        Peripheral + Central   :    PERIPHERAL_CFG+CENTRAL_CFG

    lib_search tool:    There is a pre build action for every stack project that runs a tool
                        lib_search.exe. This tool aims to automatically import the correct library
                        files into your project based on the defines in this file.

                        The locations of all library files and their correspond options are
                        <install dir>/ble_core/ble_[host,ctrl]_lib/<device> for stack libs
                        and at <install dir>/ble_core/hci_tl_lib/<device> for
                        HCI Transport Layer libs

                        If an library is found that was built with matching options, it will be
                        copied into the project local directory at <App ewp dir>/../../lib/ and
                        subsequently linked with the stack.

                        If you experience a build error with lib_search.exe, expand the build error
                        message by clicking Tools->Options->Messages->Show build messages:->All.
                        The error messages printed out by the lib_search tool should now appear in
                        your Build Message window.

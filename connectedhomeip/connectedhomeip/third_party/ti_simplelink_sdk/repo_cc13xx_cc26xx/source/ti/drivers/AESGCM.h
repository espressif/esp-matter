 * @brief      AESGCM driver header
 *
 * @anchor ti_drivers_AESGCM_Overview
 * ### Overview #
 *
 * The Galois Counter Mode (GCM) mode of operation is a generic
 * authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) block cipher mode.
 * It can be implemented with any block cipher.
 * AESGCM combines GHASH with the AES block cipher in CTR mode of operation.
 *
 * This combination of block cipher modes enables GCM to encrypt messages of any
 * length and not only multiples of the block cipher block size.
 *
 * CTR provides confidentiality. The using GHASH and encrypting the result provides
 * message integrity and authentication.
 *
 * The AES key is a shared secret between the two parties and has a length
 * of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
 *
 * The IV is generated by the party performing the authenticated
 * encryption operation.  Within the scope of any authenticated
 * encryption key, the IV value must be unique.  That is, the set of
 * IV values used with any given key must not contain any duplicate
 * values.  Using the same IV for two different messages encrypted
 * with the same key destroys the security properties of GCM.
 *
 * The optional additional authentication data (AAD) is authenticated
 * but not encrypted. Thus, the AAD is not included in the AES-GCM output.
 * It can be used to authenticate packet headers, timestamps and other
 * metadata.
 *
 * After the encryption operation, the ciphertext contains the encrypted
 * data and the message authentication code (MAC).
 *
 * GCM is highly performant for an AEAD mode. Counter with CBC-MAC requires
 * one invocation per block of AAD and two invocations of the block cipher
 * per proccessed block of input; one to compute the CBC-MAC and one to
 * perform CTR. GCM substitutes the block cipher invocation during CBC-MAC
 * computation with computing GHASH over the same input. GHASH is significantly
 * faster per block than AES. In turn, this gives GCM a performance edge
 * over CCM.
 *
 * ### Security Considerations
 *
 * In each operation, GCM limits the length of the input and AAD to guarantee
 * its security properties:
 *     - inputLength <= 2^36 - 32 bytes
 *     - aadLength <= 2^61 - 1 bytes
 *
 * The security properties of GCM rely on the MAC size. While MAC lengths of
 * [4, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] bytes are permitted, it is recommended to
 * use the full 16-byte MAC.
 *
 * See NIST SP 800-38D for more a more detailed discussion of security
 * considerations.
 *
 * @anchor ti_drivers_AESGCM_Usage
 * ### Usage #
 *
 * #### Before starting a GCM operation #
 *
 * Before starting a GCM operation, the application must do the following:
 *     - Call AESGCM_init() to initialize the driver
 *     - Call AESGCM_Params_init() to initialize the #AESGCM_Params to default values.
 *     - Modify the #AESGCM_Params as desired
 *     - Call AESGCM_open() to open an instance of the driver
 *     - Initialize a CryptoKey. These opaque data structures are representations
 *       of keying material and its storage. Depending on how the keying material
 *       is stored (RAM or flash, key store), the CryptoKey must be
 *       initialized differently. The AESGCM API can handle all types of CryptoKey.
 *       However, not all device-specific implementations support all types of CryptoKey.
 *       Devices without a key store will not support CryptoKeys with keying material
 *       stored in a key store for example.
 *       All devices support plaintext CryptoKeys.
 *     - Initialize the appropriate AESGCM operation struct using the relevant
 *       operation init functions and set all fields. For example, one-step (one-shot
 *       or single call) operations should initialize AESGCM_Operation or
 *       AESGCM_OneStepOperation using AESGCM_Operation_init() or
 *       AESGCM_OneStepOperation_init(). For multi-step (segmented or multiple call)
 *       operations, AESGCM_SegmentedAADOperation must be initialized and set when
 *       processing AAD. AESGCM_SegmentedDataOperation must be initialized and set when
 *       dealing with payload data (plaintext or ciphertext). AESGCM_SegmentedFinalizeOperation
 *       must be initialized and set when finalizing the segmented operation.
 *
 * #### Starting a GCM operation #
 *
 * The AESGCM_oneStepEncrypt() and AESGCM_oneStepDecrypt() functions perform a GCM operation in a single call.
 *
 * When performing a decryption operation with AESGCM_oneStepDecrypt(), the MAC is
 * automatically verified.
 *
 * #### After the GCM operation completes #
 *
 * After the GCM operation completes, the application should either start another operation
 * or close the driver by calling AESGCM_close()

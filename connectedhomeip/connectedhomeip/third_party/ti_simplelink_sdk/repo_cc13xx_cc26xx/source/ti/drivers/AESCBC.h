 *  # Overview #
 *  The Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of operation is a generic
 *  block cipher mode of operation. It can be used with any block cipher
 *  including AES.
 *
 *  CBC mode encrypts messages of any practical length that have a length
 *  evenly divisible by the block size. Unlike ECB, it guarantees
 *  confidentiality of the entire message when the message is larger than
 *  one block.
 *
 *  ## Operation #
 *  In CBC encryption, the initialization vector (IV) is XOR'd with a block of
 *  plaintext and then encrypted. The output ciphertext block is then XOR'd with
 *  the next plaintext block and the result is encrypted. This process is repeated
 *  until the final block of plaintext has been encrypted.
 *
 *  To decrypt the message, decrypt the first block of ciphertext and XOR the result
 *  with the IV. The result is the first plaintext block. For subsequent ciphertext
 *  blocks, decrypt each block and XOR the previous block of the encrypted message
 *  into the result.
 *
 *  ## Padding #
 *  CBC operates on entire blocks of ciphertext and plaintext at a time. This
 *  means that message lengths must be a multiple of the block cipher block size.
 *  AES has a block size of 16 bytes no matter the key size. Since messages do
 *  not necessarily always have a length that is a multiple of 16 bytes, it may
 *  be necessary to pad the message to a 16-byte boundary. Padding requires
 *  the sender and receiver to implicitly agree on the padding convention.
 *  Improperly designed or implemented padding schemes may leak information
 *  to an attacker through a padding oracle attack for example.
 *
 *  ## Initialization Vectors #
 *  The IV is generated by the party performing the encryption operation.
 *  Within the scope of any encryption key, the IV value must be unique.
 *  The IV does not need to be kept secret and is usually transmitted together
 *  with the ciphertext to the decrypting party.
 *  In CBC mode, the IVs must not be predictable. Two recommended ways to
 *  generate IVs is to either:
 *
 *  - Apply the block cipher (AESCBC), using the same key used with CBC,
 *    to a nonce. This nonce must be unique for each key-message pair.
 *    A counter will usually suffice. If the same symmetric key is used
 *    by both parties to encrypt messages, they should agree to use a
 *    nonce scheme that avoids generating the same nonce and thus IV twice.
 *    Incrementing the counter by two and making one party use even numbers
 *    and the other odd numbers is a common method to avoid such collisions.
 *  - Use a TRNG (True Random Number Generator) or PRNG
 *    (Pseudo-Random Number Generator) to generate a random number for use
 *    as IV.
 *
 *  ## Drawbacks #
 *  CBC mode has several drawbacks. Unless interfacing with legacy devices,
 *  it is recommended to use an AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)
 *  mode such as CCM or GCM. Below is a non-exhaustive list of reasons to use
 *  a different block cipher mode of operation.
 *
 *  - CBC mode does not offer authentication or integrity guarantees. In practice,
 *    this means that attackers can intercept the encrypted message and manipulate
 *    the ciphertext before sending the message on to the receiver. While this
 *    does not break confidentiality and reveal the plaintext, it has enabled several
 *    attacks in the past. This is especially problematic given that changing the
 *    ciphertext of a block will only corrupt the block itself and the subsequent
 *    block of resultant plaintext. This property may be used to manipulate only
 *    certain parts of the message.
 *
 *  - CBC mode requires message lengths to be evenly divisible by the block size.
 *    This necessitates a padding scheme. Improperly implemented padding schemes
 *    may lead to vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. It often
 *    makes more sense to use a dedicated stream cipher such as CTR (Counter) that
 *    does not have this restriction. CCM and GCM both use CTR for encryption.

 *  @anchor ti_drivers_AESCBC_Usage
 *  # Usage #
 *  ## Before starting a CBC operation #
 *
 *  Before starting a CBC operation, the application must do the following:
 *      - Call #AESCBC_init() to initialize the driver
 *      - Call #AESCBC_Params_init() to initialize the #AESCBC_Params to default values.
 *      - Modify the #AESCBC_Params as desired
 *      - Call #AESCBC_open() to open an instance of the driver
 *      - Initialize a CryptoKey. These opaque data structures are representations
 *        of keying material and its storage. Depending on how the keying material
 *        is stored (RAM or flash, key store), the CryptoKey must be
 *        initialized differently. The AESCBC API can handle all types of CryptoKey.
 *        However, not all device-specific implementations support all types of CryptoKey.
 *        Devices without a key store will not support CryptoKeys with keying material
 *        stored in a key store for example.
 *        All devices support plaintext CryptoKeys.
 *      - Initialize the appropriate AESCBC operation struct using the relevant
 *        operation init functions and set all fields. For example, one-step (one-shot
 *        or single call) operations should initialize AESCBC_Operation or
 *        AESCBC_OneStepOperation using AESCBC_Operation_init() or
 *        AESCBC_OneStepOperation_init(). For multi-step (segmented or multiple call)
 *        operations, AESCBC_SegmentedOperation must be initialized and set.
 *
 *  ## Starting a CBC operation #
 *
 *  The #AESCBC_oneStepEncrypt and #AESCBC_oneStepDecrypt functions perform a CBC operation
 *  in a single call. They will always be the most highly optimized routines with the
 *  least overhead and the fastest runtime. However, they require all plaintext
 *  or ciphertext to be available to the function at the start of the call.
 *  All devices support single call operations.
 *
 *  ## After the CBC operation completes #
 *
 *  After the CBC operation completes, the application should either start
 *  another operation or close the driver by calling #AESCBC_close().

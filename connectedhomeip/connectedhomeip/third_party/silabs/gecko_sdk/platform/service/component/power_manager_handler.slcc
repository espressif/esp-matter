  The Power Manager Handler component provides a set of events that can be
  used by other components to register handlers that must be called in the
  power manager hooks function. Handlers can be registered for the following
  events using the Event Handler API provided by the Event Handler component:

  * is_ok_to_sleep
  * sleep_on_isr_exit

  Note that the registered function MUST NOT have any side effects. It is not
  guaranteed that all registred callbacks will be called each time the system
  wakeup, i.e. if a previous callback says to wakeup then the following
  callbacks are not called as we want to wake up as fast as possible.

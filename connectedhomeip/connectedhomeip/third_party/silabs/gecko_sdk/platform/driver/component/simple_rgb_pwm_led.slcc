description: >
  The Simple RGB PWM LED Driver provides an implementation of the Generic LED 
  API. This driver supports controlling Red/Green/Blue LED sets and uses 
  Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to set the intensity of each LED.


  This component is instantiable, meaning that several named instances can be 
  created. For each instance a configuration is generated along with an 
  initialization struct set according to this configuration. These instances,
  defines, and variables are available in a generated header file,
  sl_simple_rgb_pwm_led_instances.h.


  If the Services->Runtime->System Setup->System Init component is included in
  a project, the driver instances will be initialized automatically, using the
  instance configurations, during the sl_system_init() call in main.c.


  Selecting this component will also include the Simple LED Core component, which is 
  the implementation of the Simple RGB PWM LED driver itself.

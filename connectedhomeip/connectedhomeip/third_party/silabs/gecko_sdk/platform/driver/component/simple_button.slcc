  The Simple Button Driver provides an implementation of the Generic Button API.
  This driver supports both active high and low buttons and configurable
  debouncing.


  This component is instantiable, meaning that several named instances can be
  created. For each instance a configuration is generated along with an
  initialization struct set according to this configuration. These instance
  defines and variables are available in a generated header file,
  sl_simple_button_instances.h.


  If the Services->Runtime->System Setup->System Init component is included in
  a project, the driver instances will be initialized automatically, using the
  instance configurations, during the sl_system_init() call in main.c.


  Selecting this component will also include the Simple Button Core component, which is
  the implementation of the Simple Button driver itself.

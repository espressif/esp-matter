description: >
  The Simple LED Driver provides an implementation of the Generic LED API.
  This driver supports controlling GPIO based on/off type LEDs.


  This component is instantiable, meaning that several named instances can be
  created. For each instance a configuration is generated along with an
  initialization struct set according to this configuration. These instance
  defines and variables are available in a generated header file,
  sl_simple_led_instances.h.


  If the Services->Runtime->System Setup->System Init component is included in
  a project, the driver instances will be initialized automatically, using the
  instance configurations, during the sl_system_init() call in main.c.


  Selecting this component will also include the Simple LED Core component, which is
  the implementation of the Simple LED driver itself.

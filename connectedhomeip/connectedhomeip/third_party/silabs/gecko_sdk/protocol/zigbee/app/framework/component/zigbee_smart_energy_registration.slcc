package: Zigbee
description: Silicon Labs implementation of Smart Energy Registration. The component performs
  key establishment with the trust center when the node joins a network. If the application
  implements Messaging, Price, or DRLC client clusters, the component also discovers
  ESIs on the network and performs partner link key exchange and binding with each
  ESI it discovers. ESI discovery requires the ESI Management component, in which the
  number of supported ESIs can be configured. The frequency with which ESIs are rediscovered
  is configurable. These options are ignored if the application does not implement
  Messaging, Price, or DRLC client clusters. Registration is not required for trust
  centers, so this component should be disabled if the device is acting as the trust
  center.

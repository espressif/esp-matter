  Bluetooth AppLoader application for OTA DFU.

  On series 1 devices, this component adds AppLoader binary to the application.

  On series 2 and above devices, it moves the application start address to give space for an AppLoader OTA DFU
  Bootloader. It also requires a Gecko Bootloader with an AppLoader OTA DFU plugin to be present on the device.

  AppLoader is a minimal version of the Bluetooth stack designed to enable device firmware updates over BLE connections
  It allows to update application using in-place update where the old application is directly overwritten with the new one.

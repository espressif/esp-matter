 *    (or bytes in the range [512, 1023] for a 1KB sized file).<br>

 *    represented by @p rangeStartOrlastNbytes.
 *    @p rangeStartOrlastNbytes should be >= 0 and @p rangeEnd should be
 *    #HTTP_RANGE_REQUEST_END_OF_FILE.<br>
 *    Example request header line: `Range: bytes=256-\r\n` for requesting all bytes after and
 *    including byte 256 (or bytes in the range [256,1023] for a 1kB sized file).<br>
 *    **Example**
 *    @code{c}
 *    HTTPStatus_t httpLibraryStatus = HTTPSuccess;
 *    // Assume that requestHeaders has already been initialized with
 *    // HTTPClient_InitializeRequestHeaders().
 *    HTTPRequestHeaders_t requestHeaders;
 *
 *    // Request for all bytes from byte 256 onward.
 *    httpLibraryStatus = HTTPClient_AddRangeHeader( &requestHeaders, 256, HTTP_RANGE_REQUEST_END_OF_FILE)
 *    @endcode
 *
 * @param[in] pRequestHeaders Request header buffer information.
 * @param[in] rangeStartOrlastNbytes Represents either the starting byte
 * for a range OR the last N number of bytes in the requested file.
 * @param[in] rangeEnd The ending range for the requested file. For end of file
 * byte in Range Specifications 2. and 3., #HTTP_RANGE_REQUEST_END_OF_FILE
 * should be passed.
 *
 * @return Returns the following status codes:
 * #HTTPSuccess, if successful.
 * #HTTPInvalidParameter, if input parameters are invalid, including when
 * the @p rangeStartOrlastNbytes and @p rangeEnd parameter combination is invalid.
 * #HTTPInsufficientMemory, if the passed #HTTPRequestHeaders_t.pBuffer
 * contains insufficient remaining memory for storing the range request.

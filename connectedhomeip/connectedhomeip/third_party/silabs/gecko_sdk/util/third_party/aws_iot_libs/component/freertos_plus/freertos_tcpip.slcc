  FreeRTOS Plus TCP/IP Stack.

  Note: The version provided with Gecko SDK is present for running aws_test and validate the 
  low-level implementation of IoT API. This module is not used internally by any Silicon Labs 
  component.
  Be aware that The FreeRTOS + TCPIP used by aws_test contains the following security vulnerability:

  CVE-2018-16523 - "Amazon Web Services (AWS) FreeRTOS through 1.3.1, FreeRTOS up to 
  V10.0.1 (with FreeRTOS+TCP), and WITTENSTEIN WHIS Connect middleware TCP/IP component 
  allow division by zero in prvCheckOptions."

  CVE-2018-16524 - "Amazon Web Services (AWS) FreeRTOS through 1.3.1, FreeRTOS up to 
  V10.0.1 (with FreeRTOS+TCP), and WITTENSTEIN WHIS Connect middleware TCP/IP component 
  allow information disclosure during parsing of TCP options in prvCheckOptions."

  CVE-2018-16525 - "Amazon Web Services (AWS) FreeRTOS through 1.3.1, FreeRTOS up to 
  V10.0.1 (with FreeRTOS+TCP), and WITTENSTEIN WHIS Connect middleware TCP/IP component 
  allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or leak information because of a Buffer 
  Overflow during parsing of DNS\LLMNR packets in prvParseDNSReply."

  CVE-2018-16526 - "Amazon Web Services (AWS) FreeRTOS through 1.3.1, FreeRTOS up to 
  V10.0.1 (with FreeRTOS+TCP), and WITTENSTEIN WHIS Connect middleware TCP/IP component 
  allow remote attackers to leak information or execute arbitrary code because of a 
  Buffer Overflow during generation of a protocol checksum in usGenerateProtocolChecksum 
  and prvProcessIPPacket."

  CVE-2018-16527 - "Amazon Web Services (AWS) FreeRTOS through 1.3.1, FreeRTOS up to 
  V10.0.1 (with FreeRTOS+TCP), and WITTENSTEIN WHIS Connect middleware TCP/IP component 
  allow information disclosure during parsing of ICMP packets in prvProcessICMPPacket."

  CVE-2018-16598 - "An issue was discovered in Amazon Web Services (AWS) FreeRTOS through 
  1.3.1, FreeRTOS up to V10.0.1 (with FreeRTOS+TCP), and WITTENSTEIN WHIS Connect middleware 
  TCP/IP component. In xProcessReceivedUDPPacket and prvParseDNSReply, any received DNS 
  response is accepted, without confirming it matches a sent DNS request."

  CVE-2018-16599 - "An issue was discovered in Amazon Web Services (AWS) FreeRTOS through 
  1.3.1, FreeRTOS up to V10.0.1 (with FreeRTOS+TCP), and WITTENSTEIN WHIS Connect middleware 
  TCP/IP component. Out of bounds memory access during parsing of NBNS packets in prvTreatNBNS 
  can be used for information disclosure."

  CVE-2018-16600 - "An issue was discovered in Amazon Web Services (AWS) FreeRTOS through 1.3.1, 
  FreeRTOS up to V10.0.1 (with FreeRTOS+TCP), and WITTENSTEIN WHIS Connect middleware TCP/IP 
  component. Out of bounds memory access during parsing of ARP packets in eARPProcessPacket 
  can be used for information disclosure."

  CVE-2018-16601 - "An issue was discovered in Amazon Web Services (AWS) FreeRTOS through 
  1.3.1, FreeRTOS up to V10.0.1 (with FreeRTOS+TCP), and WITTENSTEIN WHIS Connect middleware 
  TCP/IP component. A crafted IP header triggers a full memory space copy in prvProcessIPPacket, 
  leading to denial of service and possibly remote code execution."

  CVE-2018-16602 - "An issue was discovered in Amazon Web Services (AWS) FreeRTOS through 
  1.3.1, FreeRTOS up to V10.0.1 (with FreeRTOS+TCP), and WITTENSTEIN WHIS Connect middleware 
  TCP/IP component. Out of bounds memory access during parsing of DHCP responses in 
  prvProcessDHCPReplies can be used for information disclosure."

  CVE-2018-16603 - "	An issue was discovered in Amazon Web Services (AWS) FreeRTOS through 
  1.3.1, FreeRTOS up to V10.0.1 (with FreeRTOS+TCP), and WITTENSTEIN WHIS Connect middleware 
  TCP/IP component. Out of bounds access to TCP source and destination port fields in 
  xProcessReceivedTCPPacket can leak data back to an attacker."

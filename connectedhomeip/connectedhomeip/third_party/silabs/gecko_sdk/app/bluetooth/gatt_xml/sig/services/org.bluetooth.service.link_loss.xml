	<InformativeText>
        <Abstract>This service defines behavior when a link is lost between two devices.</Abstract>
        <Summary>            
    The LINK LOSS Service is instantiated as a Primary Service.
    There is only one instance of the Link Loss Service on a device.
    There is only one instance of the Alert Level characteristic in a Link Loss Service.
    This alert continues until one of following conditions occurs:
    - An implementation specific timeout
    - User interaction on this device
    - A new alert level is written
    - The physical link is disconnected
		</Summary>
	<Examples>
		<Example>If the current link loss alert level is "No Alert", no alerting is done on this device.</Example>
		<Example>If the current link loss alert level is "Mild Alert", the device alerts.</Example>
		<Example>If the current link loss alert level is "High Alert", the device alerts in the strongest possible way.</Example>
	</Examples>

# SE Manager Key Agreement (ECJPAKE)


This example uses the SE Manager API to perform the Elliptic Curve Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling (ECJPAKE) on the supported Series 2 device.


In ECJPAKE protocol, a shared secret is derived between two peers using a shared, known password.


In this example, SE Manager is used to initialize two peers that will perform a key exchange - a client, and a server. The SE Manager APIs will be used to perform the key exchange procedure, then the two shared secrets that are generated for each peer are compared.


The example redirects standard I/O to the virtual serial port (VCOM) of the kit. By default, the serial port setting is 115200 bps and 8-N-1 configuration.


The example has been instrumented with code to count the number of clock cycles spent in different operations. The results are printed on the VCOM serial port console. This feature can be disabled by defining `SE_MANAGER_PRINT=0` (default is 1) in the IDE setting (`Preprocessor->Defined symbols`).


## SE Manager API


The following SE Manager APIs are used in this example:


* `sl_se_init`
* `sl_se_deinit`
* `sl_se_init_command_context`
* `sl_se_deinit_command_context`
* `sl_se_ecjpake_init`
* `sl_se_ecjpake_setup`
* `sl_se_ecjpake_check`
* `sl_se_ecjpake_write_round_one`
* `sl_se_ecjpake_write_round_two`
* `sl_se_ecjpake_read_round_one`
* `sl_se_ecjpake_read_round_two`
* `sl_se_ecjpake_derive_secret`
* `sl_se_ecjpake_free`


## Getting Started


1. Upgrade the kit’s firmware to the latest version (see `Adapter Firmware` under [General Device Information](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-about-the-launcher/welcome-and-device-tabs#general-device-information) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide).
2. Upgrade the device’s SE firmware to the latest version (see `Secure Firmware` under [General Device Information](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-about-the-launcher/welcome-and-device-tabs#general-device-information) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide).
3. Open any terminal program and connect to the kit’s VCOM port.
4. Create this platform example project in the Simplicity IDE (see [Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-getting-started/start-a-project#examples) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide).
5. Build the example and download it to the kit (see [Simple Build](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-building-and-flashing/building#simple-build) and [Flash Programmer](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-building-and-flashing/flashing#flash-programmer) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide).
6. Run the example and the console should display the process steps of this example.

<div class="textblock"><p>This documentation describes the RPMsg-Lite component, which is a lightweight implementation of the Remote Processor Messaging (RPMsg) protocol. The RPMsg protocol defines a standardized binary interface used to communicate between multiple cores in a heterogeneous multicore system.</p>
<p>Compared to the RPMsg implementation of the Open Asymmetric Multi Processing (OpenAMP) framework (<a href="https://github.com/OpenAMP/open-amp">https://github.com/OpenAMP/open-amp</a>), the RPMsg-Lite offers a code size reduction, API simplification, and improved modularity. On smaller Cortex-M0+ based systems, it is recommended to use RPMsg-Lite.</p>
<p>The RPMsg-Lite is an open-source component developed by NXP Semiconductors and released under the BSD-compatible license.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="motivation"></a>
Motivation to create RPMsg-Lite</h1>
<p>There are multiple reasons why RPMsg-Lite was developed. One reason is the need for the small footprint of the RPMsg protocol-compatible communication component, another reason is the simplification of extensive API of OpenAMP RPMsg implementation.</p>
<p>RPMsg protocol was not documented, and its only definition was given by the Linux Kernel and legacy OpenAMP implementations. This has changed with [1] which is a standardization protocol allowing multiple different implementations to coexist and still be mutually compatible.</p>
<p>Small MCU-based systems often do not implement dynamic memory allocation. The creation of static API in RPMsg-Lite enables another reduction of resource usage. Not only does the dynamic allocation adds another 5 KB of code size, but also communication is slower and less deterministic, which is a property introduced by dynamic memory. The following table shows some rough comparison data between the OpenAMP RPMsg implementation and new RPMsg-Lite implementation:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Component / Configuration </th><th>Flash [B] </th><th>RAM [B]  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>OpenAMP RPMsg / Release (reference) </td><td>5547 </td><td>456 + dynamic </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>RPMsg-Lite / Dynamic API, Release </td><td>3462 </td><td>56 + dynamic </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Relative Difference [%] </td><td>~62.4% </td><td>~12.3% </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>RPMsg-Lite / Static API (no malloc), Release </td><td>2926 </td><td>352 </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Relative Difference [%] </td><td>~52.7% </td><td>~77.2% </td></tr>
</table>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="implementation"></a>
Implementation</h1>
<p>The implementation of RPMsg-Lite can be divided into three sub-components, from which two are optional. The core component is situated in <em>rpmsg_lite.c</em>. Two optional components are used to implement a blocking receive API (in <em>rpmsg_queue.c</em>) and dynamic "named" endpoint creation and deletion announcement service (in <em>rpmsg_ns.c</em>).</p>
<p>The actual "media access" layer is implemented in <em>virtqueue.c</em>, which is one of the few files shared with the OpenAMP implementation. This layer mainly defines the shared memory model, and internally defines used components such as vring or virtqueue.</p>
<p>The porting layer is split into two sub-layers: the environment layer and the platform layer. The first sublayer is to be implemented separately for each environment. (The bare metal environment already exists and is implemented in <em>rpmsg_env_bm.c</em>, and the FreeRTOS environment is implemented in <em>rpmsg_env_freertos.c</em> etc.) Only the source file, which matches the used environment, is included in the target application project. The second sublayer is implemented in <em>rpmsg_platform.c</em> and defines low-level functions for interrupt enabling, disabling, and triggering mainly. The situation is described in the following figure:</p>
<div class="image">

<div class="caption">
RPMsg-Lite Architecture</div></div>
 <h2><a class="anchor" id="rpmsg_lite_core"></a>
RPMsg-Lite core sub-component</h2>
<p>This subcomponent implements a blocking send API and callback-based receive API. The RPMsg protocol is part of the transport layer. This is realized by using so-called endpoints. Each endpoint can be assigned a different receive callback function. However, it is important to notice that the callback is executed in an interrupt environment in current design. Therefore, certain actions like memory allocation are discouraged to execute in the callback. The following figure shows the role of RPMsg in an ISO/OSI-like layered model:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="rpmsg_isoosi.png" alt="rpmsg_isoosi.png"/>
<div class="caption">
RPMsg ISO/OSI Layered Model</div></div>
 <h2><a class="anchor" id="rpmsg_queue"></a>
Queue sub-component (optional)</h2>
<p>This subcomponent is optional and requires implementation of the env_*_queue() functions in the environment porting layer. It uses a blocking receive API, which is common in RTOS-environments. It supports both copy and nocopy blocking receive functions.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="rpmsg_nameservice"></a>
Name Service sub-component (optional)</h2>
<p>This subcomponent is a minimum implementation of the name service which is present in the Linux Kernel implementation of RPMsg. It allows the communicating node both to send announcements about "named" endpoint (in other words, channel) creation or deletion and to receive these announcement taking any user-defined action in an application callback. The endpoint address used to receive name service announcements is arbitrarily fixed to be 53 (0x35).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="usage"></a>
Usage</h1>
<p>The application should put the /rpmsg_lite/lib/include directory to the include path and in the application, include either the <a class="el" href="rpmsg__lite_8h_source.html">rpmsg_lite.h</a> header file, or optionally also include the <a class="el" href="rpmsg__queue_8h_source.html">rpmsg_queue.h</a> and/or <a class="el" href="rpmsg__ns_8h_source.html">rpmsg_ns.h</a> files. Both porting sublayers should be provided for you by NXP, but if you plan to use your own RTOS, all you need to do is to implement your own environment layer (in other words, rpmsg_env_myrtos.c) and to include it in the project build.</p>
<p>The initialization of the stack is done by calling the <a class="el" href="group__rpmsg__lite.html#ga6ceae6c968214f8aa26be31ff1f4fc58" title="Initializes the RPMsg-Lite communication stack. Must be called prior to any other RPMSG lite API...">rpmsg_lite_master_init()</a> on the master side and the <a class="el" href="group__rpmsg__lite.html#gaf6d18dec47cdd58d56505e39cf010991" title="Initializes the RPMsg-Lite communication stack. Must be called prior to any other RPMsg-Lite API...">rpmsg_lite_remote_init()</a> on the remote side. This initialization function must be called prior to any RPMsg-Lite API call. After the init, it is wise to create a communication endpoint, otherwise communication is not possible. This can be done by calling the <a class="el" href="group__rpmsg__lite.html#gaf9bf28acdd0143208f6e160dbb879fd3" title="Create a new rpmsg endpoint, which can be used for communication. ">rpmsg_lite_create_ept()</a> function. It optionally accepts a last argument, where an internal context of the endpoint is created, just in case the RL_USE_STATIC_API option is set to 1. If not, the stack internally calls env_alloc() to allocate dynamic memory for it. In case a callback-based receiving is to be used, an ISR-callback is registered to each new endpoint with user-defined callback data pointer. If a blocking receive is desired (in case of RTOS environment), the <a class="el" href="group__rpmsg__queue.html#gaf2b13335342ec06d8c264bbb6e27c88f" title="Create a RPMsg queue which can be used for blocking reception.

">rpmsg_lite_create_ept()</a>. The queue handle is passed to the endpoint creation function as a callback data argument and the callback function is set to <a class="el" href="group__rpmsg__queue.html#ga5333db7bb4b09c87ae4ad9c75dc610a5" title="This callback needs to be registered with an endpoint. ">rpmsg_queue_rx_cb()</a>. Then, it is possible to use rpmsg_queue_receive() function to listen on a queue object for incoming messages.

<p>The RPMsg-Lite also implements no-copy mechanisms for both sending and receiving operations. These methods require specifics that have to be considered when used in an application.</p>
<p><b>no-copy-send mechanism:</b> This mechanism allows sending messages without the cost for copying data from the application buffer to the RPMsg/virtio buffer in the shared memory. The sequence of no-copy sending steps to be performed is as follows:</p><ul>

<li>Fill the data to be sent into the pre-allocated virtio buffer. Ensure that the filled data does not exceed the buffer size (provided as the <a class="el" href="group__rpmsg__lite.html#gaafaf83655850247f8408ab8a17a6e557" title="Allocates the tx buffer for message payload.

</ul>
<p><b>no-copy-receive mechanism:</b> This mechanism allows reading messages without the cost for copying data from the virtio buffer in the shared memory to the application buffer. The sequence of no-copy receiving steps to be performed is as follows:</p><ul>

</ul>
<p>The user is responsible for destroying any RPMsg-Lite objects he has created in case of deinitialization. In order to do this, the function <a class="el" href="group__rpmsg__queue.html#ga90d72e18752f3dad3cf9cab348186e6b" title="Destroy a queue and clean up.

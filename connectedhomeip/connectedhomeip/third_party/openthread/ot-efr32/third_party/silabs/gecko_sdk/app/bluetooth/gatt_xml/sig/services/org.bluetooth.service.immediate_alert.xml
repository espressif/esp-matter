        <Abstract>This service exposes a control point to allow a peer device to cause the device to immediately alert.</Abstract>
        <Summary>
    The Immediate Alert service is instantiated as a Primary Service.
    There is only one instance of the Immediate Alert service on a device.
    There is only one instance of the Alert Level characteristic in an Immediate Alert service.
    This alert continues until one of following conditions occurs:
    - An implementation specific timeout
    - User interaction on this device
    - A new alert level is written
    - The physical link is disconnected
		</Summary>
    	<Examples>
	    	<Example>If the written alert level is "No Alert", no alerting is done on this device.</Example>
		    <Example>If the written alert level is "Mild Alert", the device alerts.</Example>
		    <Example>If the written alert level is "High Alert", the device alerts in the strongest possible way.</Example>

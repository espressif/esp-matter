   This component provides "sl_cmsis_os2_common.h" header file, which in
   turn provides typedefs like osSemaphore_t and osThread_t.

   Those types are defined by CMSIS RTOS2 standard, yet their implementation
   is specific to the operating system. Traditionally, the user would need to
   include OS-specific header file (like "os.h" for MicriumOS) to have access
   to those types. This implies that the application needs to be aware of
   the kernel being used (MicriumOS, FreeRTOS, etc.)

   For applications that need to be OS-agnostic, this component provides
   an abstract header file "sl_cmsis_os2_common.h" that provides the same
   functionality without the requirement of knowing which OS is used per se.

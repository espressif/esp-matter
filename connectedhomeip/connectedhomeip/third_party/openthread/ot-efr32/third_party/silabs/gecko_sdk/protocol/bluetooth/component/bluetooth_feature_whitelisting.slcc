  Bluetooth accept list filtering.

  Currently this feature only supports the scanning. It does not work with
  advertisers that use resolvable private addresses (RPA) since the address
  resolving is performed by the Bluetooth host. RPA addresses may be rejected by
  the filtering since they are unknown to the controller.

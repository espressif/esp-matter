package: platform
description: >
  This component provides functions to initialize/deinitialize the default NVM3
  instance. The instance can be accessed with the NVM3 API by using the
  nvm3_defaultHandle provided in nvm3_default.h as the nvm3_Handle_t pointer.


  If the Services->Runtime->System Setup component is included in a
  project, the default instance will be initialized automatically, using
  the default instance configuration, during the sl_system_init() call in main.c.


  Selecting this component will also include the NVM3 Core component, which is
  the implementation of the NVM3 driver itself.

label: "Scanner for legacy advertisements"
package: "Bluetooth"
description: >
  This component brings in necessary functionalities for scanning the advertisements
  that use legacy advertising PDUs.

  Include this component if the application does not need to scan advertisements
  that use extended advertising PDUs. Advertisements received by the scanner are
  reported in the BGAPI sl_bt_evt_scanner_legacy_advertisement_report event.

  If this component is included and the <bluetooth_feature_extended_scanner> is
  not, the number of received advertisement reports are reduced if advertising
  devices that use extended advertising PDUs are in the radio range. Another
  benefit of including this component only is reduced application size by
  eliminating the stack functionalities for scanning advertisements that use
  extended advertising PDUs.

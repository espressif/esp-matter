    <Abstract>
      The SYSTEM ID characteristic consists of a structure with two fields. The first field are the LSOs and the second field contains the MSOs.
      This is a 64-bit structure which consists of a 40-bit manufacturer-defined identifier concatenated with a 24 bit unique Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI). The OUI is issued by the IEEE Registration Authority (http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/index.html) and is required to be used in accordance with IEEE Standard 802-2001.6 while the least significant 40 bits are manufacturer defined.
      If System ID generated based on a Bluetooth Device Address, it is required to be done as follows. System ID and the Bluetooth Device Address have a very similar structure: a Bluetooth Device Address is 48 bits in length and consists of a 24 bit Company Assigned Identifier (manufacturer defined identifier) concatenated with a 24 bit Company Identifier (OUI). In order to encapsulate a Bluetooth Device Address as System ID, the Company Identifier is concatenated with 0xFFFE followed by the Company Assigned Identifier of the Bluetooth Address. For more guidelines related to EUI-64, refer to http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/eui64.pdf.

    <Examples>
      <Example>If the system ID is based of a Bluetooth Device Address with a Company Identifier (OUI) is 0x123456 and the Company Assigned Identifier is 0x9ABCDE, then the System Identifier is required to be 0x123456FFFE9ABCDE.</Example>
